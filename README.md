</p>

Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women, and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common form of breast cancer. Accurately identifying and categorizing breast cancer subtypes is an important clinical task, and automated methods can be used to save time and reduce error.
In this note book we will try to identify if the patient has IDC or not by using CNN.

# Objective of this project
-  To study the factors which influence the fluctuations in the
airfare prices and how they are related to the change in the
prices. 

- The observations made in this paper will help the buyersto plan
their journey in a smart and cost-effecient manner. The
passengers will know when to travel, which airline to travel with
and what part of the day to travel so as to make it a pocket
friendly booking.

# Dataset
The original dataset consisted of 162 whole mount slide images of Breast Cancer (BCa) specimens scanned at 40x. From that, 277,524 patches of size 50 x 50 were extracted (198,738 IDC negative and 78,786 IDC positive). Each patch’s file name is of the format: u_xX_yY_classC.png — > example 10253_idx5_x1351_y1101_class0.png . Where u is the patient ID (10253_idx5), X is the x-coordinate of where this patch was cropped from, Y is the y-coordinate of where this patch was cropped from, and C indicates the class where 0 is non-IDC and 1 is IDC.

The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images).

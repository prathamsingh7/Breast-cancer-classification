</p>

Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women, and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common form of breast cancer. Accurately identifying and categorizing breast cancer subtypes is an important clinical task, and automated methods can be used to save time and reduce error.
In this note book we will try to identify if the patient has IDC or not by using CNN.

# Objective of this project
-  To study the factors which influence the fluctuations in the
airfare prices and how they are related to the change in the
prices. 

- The observations made in this paper will help the buyersto plan
their journey in a smart and cost-effecient manner. The
passengers will know when to travel, which airline to travel with
and what part of the day to travel so as to make it a pocket
friendly booking.

# Dataset
I have extracted the data from [Aertrip](https://aertrip.com/v2/flights) using ***Selenium***.
